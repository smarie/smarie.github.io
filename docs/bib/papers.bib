abstract = {The heterogeneity of metadata within Building Management Systems (BMS) poses substantial challenges for advanced analytics, including cross-building analysis. Over the past decade, metadata standard schemas such as Brick have been developed to address this challenge. Nevertheless, mapping BMS metadata with such standards accurately and efficiently continues to be a demanding task across both new and existing buildings. This work explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to tag BMS data points, thus facilitating metadata standardization efforts. Manual or rule-based methods are not only labor-intensive but also error-prone. Similarly, supervised learning approaches using Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) demand extensive labeled datasets, often making them laborious and inflexible to new BMS metadata types and tasks. We propose a novel three-step framework that enhances the tagging process by integrating a LLM with few-shot prompting and an embedding model. This approach not only improves result interpretability but also effectively mitigates hallucinations. This framework is further supported by analyses of the LLM’s inherent capabilities, prompt-aided specific interpretation and output formatting, and evaluations of few-shot sizes. Tested across five different building datasets, our approach, leveraging few-shot examples, achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised learning methods that rely on large labeled datasets.}

abstract = {Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment faults and operational errors result in comfort issues and waste of energy in buildings. An Automatic Fault Detection and Diagnosis (AFDD) tool could help facility managers fix comfort and energy issues more efficiently, by identifying the most probable root causes. Existing AFDD methods mostly focus on equipment-level fault detection and diagnostics; almost no attention is given to building level fault diagnosis, considering inter-dependency between equipment through the energy distribution chain. In this work we propose a methodology to automatically derive a Bayesian network from HVAC system topology description such as Haystack. This Bayesian network models and estimates the state of all elements in the system, helping users to identify the most probable root fault. As it is able to ingest evidence from any source (field data, operators, or other models) and is capable of updating its estimates when new evidence is delivered, such a tool could have a great potential to be used interactively on the field. We applied the proposed methodology on simulated and real-world buildings and present in this paper one specific case.}

abstract = {This paper presents an exploration of the usage of Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks, or HGATs, for the task of Passage Retrieval. More precisely, we study how these models perform to alleviate the problem of passage contextualization, that is incorporating information about the context of a passage (its containing document, neighbouring passages, etc.) in its relevance estimation. We first propose several configurations to compute contextualized passage representations, including a document graph representation composed of contextualizing signals and judiciously modified HGAT architectures. We then present how we integrate these configurations in a neural passage ranking model. We evaluate our approach on a Passage Retrieval task on patent documents: CLEF-IP2013, as these documents possess several different contextualizing signals fully exploited in our models. Our results show that some HGAT architecture modifications allow for a better context representation leading to improved performances and stability.}

abstract = {The definition of a metric between time series is inherent to several data analysis and mining tasks, including clustering, classification or forecasting. Time series data present naturally several modalities covering their amplitude, behavior or frequential spectrum, that may be expressed with varying delays and at multiple temporal scales—exhibited globally or locally. Combining several modalities at multiple temporal scales to learn a holistic metric is a key challenge for many real temporal data applications. This paper proposes a Multi-modal and Multi-scale Temporal Metric Learning (m2tml) approach for a robust time series nearest neighbors classification. The solution lies in embedding time series into a dissimilarity space where a pairwise svm is used to learn both linear and non linear combined metric. A sparse and interpretable variant of the solution shows the ability of the learned temporal metric to localize accurately discriminative modalities as well as their temporal scales. A wide range of 30 public and challenging datasets, encompassing images, traces and ecg data, are used to show the efficiency and the potential of m2tml for an effective time series nearest neighbors classification.}

abstract = {Learning the structure of Bayesian networks from data is a NP-Hard problem that involves optimization over a super-exponential sized space. Still, in many real-life datasets a number of the arcs contained in the final structure correspond to strongly related pairs of variables and can be identified efficiently with information-theoretic metrics. In this work, we propose a meta-algorithm to accelerate any existing Bayesian network structure learning method. It contains an additional arc pre-screening step allowing to narrow the structure learning task down to a subset of the original variables, thus reducing the overall problem size. We conduct extensive experiments on both public benchmarks and private industrial datasets, showing that this approach enables a significant decrease in computational time and graph complexity for little to no decrease in performance score.},

relevance to a query. A usual practice is to consider the context a passage appears in (its containing document,
neighbour passages, etc.) to improve its relevance estimation. In this work, we study the use of Graph Attention Networks (GATs), a graph node embedding method, to perform passage contextualization. More precisely, we first propose a document graph representation based on several inter- and intra-document relations. Then, we investigate two ways of leveraging the use of GATs on this representation in order to incorporate contextual information for passage retrieval. We evaluate our approach on a Passage Retrieval task for structured documents: CLEF-IP2013. Our results show that our document graph representation coupled with the expressive power of GATs allows for a better context representation leading to improved performances.},
