## Current position

I am currently a senior machine learning expert and data science manager at Schneider Electric's 
[Artificial Intelligence Hub](https://www.se.com/ww/en/work/solutions/artificial-intelligence/hub.jsp) in Grenoble, 
France. My work is stretched between research activities and development of AI solutions in production. 

We develop AI products to monitor and control complex electrical and industrial systems - in tertiary buildings, 
datacenters, industries and infrastructures. The intent is to make their operation easier, safer, more reliable and 
more energy efficient. 

I am particularly involved with machine learning and pattern mining on industrial timeseries ; with fault detection 
and predictive maintenance ; with semantic description through  ontologies ; and with forecasting for 
optimal control.

In parallel to my research, development and management activities I animate an internal group of python users, 
contribute to open source libraries, and participate in educational projects with UGA university and ENSIMAG 
engineering school.

## Previously at Schneider Electric

I joined Schneider Electric in 2005 as an embedded software engineer, to imagine how industrial gateways could leverage
Service-Oriented Architectures, Plug'n play protocols, M2M and Web 2.0. I led technical developments and research 
within the frame of EU-funded research projects, and transferred some results into industrial IoT offers.

In 2010, I joined an energy efficiency program for tertiary buildings, leading Monitoring & Analytics topics. 
I developed a platform used for BI and Visual Analytics prototypes. I opened research collaborations with major 
universities and labs and assessed key technology partners.

Since 2013 I have been involved in the development of our Analytics-as-a-Service cloud 
platform and the development of multiple AI components, with production targets such as the various [Schneider 
Electric EcoStruxure Advisors](https://www.se.com/ww/en/work/campaign/innovation/overview.jsp) and the [Exchange 
platform](https://exchange.se.com/).


## Before Schneider Electric

Before joining Schneider Electric, I received my General Engineering degree from [CentraleSupelec](https://www.
centralesupelec.fr/) (Paris) and a MSc in Machine Learning from [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) (London) in 2005 - 
with a thesis on Automated Medical Diagnosis using Semi-Supervised Learning, an internship on Robotic 
Tele-echography force-feedback, and a junior enterprise customer project on truck loading optimization.
